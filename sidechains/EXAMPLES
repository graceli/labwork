    Example usage:
    g_parse_index -f traj_nosol.xtc -s traj_nosol.gro -n index_with_only_polar_parts.ndx [options ...]

    Notes:
    -f I've only ever passed in the nosol xtc because its faster to process;
       No waters are ever analyzed anyways

    -s Gros worked for gromacs-3.3.1, not sure if they will with gromacs 4

    -n must contain a correct selection of backbone and lysine and glutamate sidechains.  If sidechains don't exist in selection, it will still work fine
    for backbone.

    [options ..]  these are for setting files names for the output files. if
                  not specifically set, then the default hard coded file names
                  will be used
