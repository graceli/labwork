Problem:
- Large number of small trajectories
- Large number of small outputs with different flat file formats (from analysis programs 
written in C that persist data in unstructured ASCII form)

Let analysis outputs be called "results"

Want:
- association of meta-data with results
- to store and retrieval of columnar data 
- to easily and cleanly execute data aggregation functions on results

Solution:
- Perform data integration and unify data into pytables
	- this allows us to perform queries using python (rather than using grep, awk and random linux tools)
- can then use the numpy framework to aggregate data - eg distributions, averages

Python implementation:
- result.py -- class which represents the data; the core data structure is the pytable
- xvgfile.py -- class representing the file type .xvg and converts a given xvg into python data structure
- loader.py -- class that modifies the pytables in result
- main.py -- driver script that calls the loader on datasets on disk

(very helpful in getting started with pytables)
