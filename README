Problem:
- Large number of small trajectories
- Analysis programs written in C that performs file IO and persists data in unstructured ASCII form
- Let analysis output be called "results"

we want:
- Associate meta-data with results
- storage and retrieval of columnar data 
- easily and cleanly execute data aggregation functions on results

solution:
- encompass current ad hoc ASCII results using pytables
	- this allows us to perform queries using python (rather than using grep, awk and random linux tools)
- can then use the numpy framework to aggregate data - eg distributions, averages

This repo contains some beginner hacky in-progress scripts that works with pytables
and imports some test data into the tables
