A not for dummies getting started with Gromacs Guide

Note: Please refer to all the references when learning how to run with Gromacs 

#get a parameter file (top file)
#-ter is interactively select terminii.  This is because for adp you have special terminii caps not recognized by pdb2gmx
# pdb2gmx will also automatically output a posre.itp. This are extra harmonic functions to position restrain your protein for
# the initial equilibration run
pdb2gmx -f adp.gro -ter -p yourtopol.top -o yournewgrofile.gro  


#solvate the system with water
#then make sure to add #include "tip3p.itp" or whatever water model you are using to your topology file
genbox -cp adp.gro -cs /path/to/grofile.gro -p yourtopol.top -o adp_water.gro

#Energy minimization step
#create the tpr file; all you need is the tpr file for the simulation (its a bundle of your system and topology for the simulator engine to initiate your simulations)
grompp -f em.mdp -c adp_water.gro -p yourtopol.top -o em.tpr
mdrun -s em.tpr -deffnm em    #-deffnm just defines the same file name "em" for all output files

#equilibration and "production" MD steps follow the exact same executable work flow steps 
#grompp to make tpr
#mdrun to run simulation
# if you want to position restraint the protein
# you can use "genposres" to generate a itp for a selection of atoms


#Analysis
#Useful analysis tools
#Very useful to go through the list of the utility programs that gromacs comes with
#before you start coding anything - saves you a lot of time!
http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Gromacs_Utilities

some notable ones that lab members use:
g_rms - calculates rmsd of protein
g_rdf - calculations radial distribution functions
g_analyze - various analysis tools (averages, error bars .. etc)
g_energy - extracts Thermodynamic parameters from your system

pretty much you name it gromacs has it ... just make sure to look first.
