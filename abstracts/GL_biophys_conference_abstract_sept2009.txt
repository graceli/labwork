Molecular Mechanism of Inhibition of Amyloid formation by Inositol 
  
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease with no cure.  Currently, one method of targeting the underlying disease is to prevent or reverse the amyloid formation of Abeta1-42, a key pathological hallmark of AD.  Scyllo-inositol is a promising small-molecule therapeutic that is found to exhibit stereochemistry dependent inhibition of formation of Abeta fibrils in vitro.  Although scyllo-inositol has been shown to successfully prevent and reverse the on-set of disease in mice models of AD and is currently in phase two of clinical trials, its mechanism of action is not known. 
  
We have performed a systematic comparative molecular dynamics simulation study of scyllo-inositol and its inactive stereoisomer chiro-inositol with various amyloid species along the aggregation pathway of Abeta using the model peptide KLVFFAE (or Abeta16-22).  We find that inositol binds to the backbone, polar and charged groups of sidechains of KLVFFAE.  There is no binding affinity differences between chiro- and scyllo-, but there are affinity differences for aggregates of different morphology. In particular inositol favors binding to beta-sheet oligomers (or protofibrils) over disordered aggregates and monomers.   We also show that the presence of charged sidechains contributes to the increase in affinity significantly and that there is a key difference in binding mode between scyllo- and chiro- with aromatic sidechains due to their differences in stereochemistry.
