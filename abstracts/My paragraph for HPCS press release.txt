One out of eight people aged 65 or older has Alzheimer's Disease (AD). With the increasing longevity of our population, AD is approaching epidemic proportions with no cure or preventative therapy available. Using computational methods and HPC, we are studying at how a promising drug candidate, scyllo-inositol works to combat Abeta, a protein that is central to causing the neurodegeneration in AD. The computing power and storage provided by SciNet is a significant contributor to both the data generation and analysis related to this project.  From our current research results,  we have gained insight into the design and improvement of small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of AD.
