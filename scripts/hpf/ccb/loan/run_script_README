Usage:

1) rename MYSYS_template_grompp and MYSYS_template_mdrun.sh by replacing MYSYS with your own system name
2) Manually run the first job by adapting the template_mdrun.sh 
	make sure that the following files are outputted from this initial manual run:
		MYMOL_IN.gro
		MYMOL_IN.trr
		MYMOL_IN.edr
		MYMOL.top
	this means, your initial mdrun should be executed with -deffnm MYMOL_IN and that your topology file should be
	named MYMOL.top
   label the initial run as md0, and output files with md1

3) Once this initial run starts, edit the files MYSYS_template_grompp and MYSYS_template_mdrun.sh as directed by the comments
inside the files and execute the driver file.  This is the continuation part of the run.  This part will automatically use tpbconv to 
continue your run, once the initial run is done. Set START=1 and END to however long you want your run to be.
