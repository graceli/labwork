 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BACK UP EVERYTHING FIRST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- Repartitioning harddrive
- Installing fresh copy of Kubuntu Hardy Heron (I think its the RC version)
- mounting file systems appropriately
- Post installation : setting up drivers 

Repartitioning harddrive:

The following was done using the partition editor that was provided with the Kubuntu Hardy heron desktop 
CD:

1) Deleted the linux partition
2) Resized Windows partition down 
3) Created the following partitions
- Primary for mounting "/" (280 gigs)
- Logical for mounting "/home" (22 gigs)

Mounting information 

Primary /dev/sda1 20 gigs ntfs
Primary /dev/sda2 275 gigs ext3 "/"
Logical /dev/sda5 23 gigs ext3 "/home"
Logical /dev/sda6 swap


... Then I started to reconfigure my desktop setting to what it was before ...
then realizing that I hadn't left space for all my data!! So, then
1) made a live CD of gparted
2) booted off of the live CD - this is important because the partition you are editing has to be unmounted
3) resized the "/" mounted partition to 50 gigs
4) made the freed space a primary partition with ext3 FS
5) booted into Kubuntu with no problems
6) sudo mkdir /work 
7) manually edited /etc/fstab to mount /work automatically
and  Windows partition (Was not mounted automatically)
[Note: the fstab file is the specification file for how to mount the various partitions at boot up] 

The following is the current /etc/fstab file contents:

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
# /dev/sda1
UUID=8EC48DD2C48DBCC9                     /media/windows  ntfs-3g defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0 1
# /dev/sda2
UUID=af828193-9c8c-4ced-9473-fd252f3b8b7c /               ext3    relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1
# /dev/sda5
UUID=beb2176c-a785-4fcd-93b6-9ad82e7c3a30 /home           ext3    defaults        0       2
# /dev/sda4
UUID=fa833d99-1188-49ad-9ee6-5cbed4c7173a /work           ext3    defaults        0       2
# /dev/sda6
UUID=4d08b698-1f00-46ae-b269-4a30b801f644 none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0

the mounting options for sda1 I copied from some random blog about how to mount windows parition under 
ubuntu (I think)

defaults is a good enough setting for /home and /work
the "relatime" option makes both non-permissible for users to make modification. I have no idea
what this option stands for.

[ Note: UUIDs are used instead of /dev/name_of_device for uniqueness.  To get the UUID of a device
use: sudo vol_info /dev/name_of_device or udevinfo -q env -n /dev/name_of_device ]

Post-installation:
- Fonts: turning on anti-aliasing seems to have made the fonts look like the way I had it with 6.10
- Nvidia drivers
	- use apt-get to get a script called "envy" - automatically gets ATI or NVIDIA drivers based on the card it auto detects from your computer

- C and C++ compilers
- open mpi libraries and lam to compile parallel versions of gromacs

- compiling Gnuplot with readline, and x11 terminal
  - need to specify where the X libraries are to the configure script !!  The default configure script is not looking where Kubuntu puts it
  - specify --with-x
  - need to install readline libraries
  essentially running ./configure will tell you what you need to do to get gnuplot compiled in the way you want it
- need PDFlite if what pdf terminal - this is not opensource

- adding the printer (no color)
