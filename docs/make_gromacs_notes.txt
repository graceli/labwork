Gnu autotools triplet: automake autoconf libtool
see autobook : http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/
see gromacs development_tools : http://wiki.gromacs.org/index.php?title=Development_Tools&printable=yes
Gromacs requires autoconf version >=2.5 and automake >=1.4f

configure.ac --> autoconf --> creates "configure" script 
Makefile.in --> configure --> creates final Makefiles

Makefile.am --> automake --> Makefile.in --> configure --> Makefile

Makefile.am - automake template

According to the gromacs development FAQ

- to Add to or edit the standard package Makefile, always edit Makefile.am and only add logical dependencies.  Configure.ac is used for system dependences

copied g_mydist.c and gmx_mydist.c to ~/gromacs-3.3.1/src/tools
go to the top level ~/gromacs-3.3.1
automake (must get the right version automake 1.4-p6 did not work, but worked after updating to automake 1.9) -- no output were generated -- I assume that means success
./configure
make (this is at the top level)
This worked and generated the g_mydist binary (along with the rest of the binaries that came with the package)

However

cd src/tools
make 

does not work and I get an make error of "no rule to make target '../mdlib/libmd.la' needed by average"
Not sure why this is so.
