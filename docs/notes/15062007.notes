- wrote a qsub script to submit to CCB
testing out with qrsh (interactive queue) as suggested on the CCB documentation website
when using ....cneale....fftw-3.1.2/bin/mdrun
kept getting the error:
	 error while loading shared libraries: libXm.so.2 ... file not found

located libXm.so in /hpf/tools/local/lib and /tools/local/lib (by browsing teh directories randomly..)
sarah had /tools/...
but even after include these in -v LD_LIBRARY_PATH  qrsh didn't work!
but qsub did...why???
