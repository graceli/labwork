A water channel was identified in p450cam involving a water cluster on the proximal side of the heme near heme propionate A
...
A water chain from the bulk solvent to the active site is not seen in the p450cam structures, but is possible if an arginine propiante salt link is broken by rotation of the arginine

multiple channels 
	- substrate filter
	- allowing pipeline of P450s to be constructued
