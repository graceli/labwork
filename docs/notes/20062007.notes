- decided to read about stochastic dynamics when Chris said "you should be using the sd integrator in gromacs for in vacuo simulations" (Leach, 2001,chap7)
stochastic dynamics basically integrates one form of equation of motion with a frictional drag force, and random fluctuations...
my thoughts are that the EoMs approximates the presence of solvent
molecular dynamics is different and probably has different set of assumptions and different equations.

- started reading about hard sphere simulations -- this is basically what that sphere bouncing program attempted to emulate. the Engine does exactly this while the graphical
front end draws and updates the rendering. *** try as a side project
