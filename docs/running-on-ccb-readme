Notes on running on CCB:

For the simple script:
-CCB does not know where your files are or your environment variables (Lucy does, through reading your bashrc file)
-To let it know where your files are:
you must include the path of the directory where the files are located
#$ -v PATH=.
-Do not put an ampersand at the end of the executable
-test whether the directory you have typed is correct and that your executable will actually run
(ie correct num of params etc)
